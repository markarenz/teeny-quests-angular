  <h2>How to Quest Your Best in Teeny Quest</h2>
  <p>
    In some levels, your goal is to collect as much loot as you can and find the special exit with a swirly pattern on
    the door. In others, you'll need to collect specific items or complete a task. The goal of the level is really up to
    the level designer.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i>"Designing levels?" you say?</i>
  </p>
  <p>
    Why, yes! Just register an account and go to the game editor screen
    to start crafting quests like a boss- or like an end boss if you're into puns. If not, just ignore that last bit.
  </p>
  <p>
    The game saves after every action, so you can come back to any game and pick up where you left off. If you want
    to reset your progress, click the "reset progress" button on the game page.

      <h3>Movement</h3>
      <p>
        Movement is very simple. Just click on the map cell where you want to move. You may notice that your movement is
        limited based on where you are and where you want to go. For example, if you're standing next to a big wall with
        an area on top to walk around, you won't see a green dot on that map cell to click on since there is no path
        from here to there. You'll need to explore and interact with your environment to find all the little surprises
        the level designers have laid out for you to find.

        Low light can limit your movement as well. If you're in a dark area, your range of movement is reduced until you
        find a way to light up the area if one exists. If you light two torches, the entire area will be lit fully.
        Other
        items or props may emit light as well.

      <h3>Exits</h3>
      <p>
        To use a door, stand next to it. If it's unlocked you can click on it to go through. If you find it locked,
        you'll need to get a key of the same color to get through, usually silver or gold.
        The exits don't have to be perfectly logical, so a designer may decide to make a door facing south open to the
        east because why not? Confusion is fun, and context is for boring people with no imagination.

      <h3>Items</h3>
      <p>
        You found something. Fantastic! If it's an item you can take, stand in the same map cell and you'll see it in a
        bubble over your head where you can click on it to take it. Once you have an item in your inventory, you can
        drop it or use it. Using an item is contextual so the use button will only be available in certain
        circumstances. For
        example, if you're standing next to a door with a silver lock and you happen to have a silver key in your
        inventory, the use button will be enabled.

      <h3>Interactive Props</h3>
      <p>
        There are all sorts of props and other elements in the world to interact with. If you see a switch on the wall
        click
        on it to turn something on or off. Maybe you turned on a torch or made a change in another room. Explore to find
        out. You can also click on banners, which change color when clicked and can act like switches with 3 states.
        Designers can use these as decorations or to service a puzzle.
